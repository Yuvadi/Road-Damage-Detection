I am especially grateful to Dr. Amr Talaat for the extensive guidance and assistance he provided throughout this project. Without his wide-ranging knowledge and acumen, this piece of work would not be as it is today and may well have fallen short of reaching its goal.

Special thanks go out to my friends for friendship and support that have been sources of comfort and inspiration. Due to them, this journey certainly has been special.
